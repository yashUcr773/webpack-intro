# Injecting Styles
- There are many ways to inject styles in html.
- The simplest way is to import styles in the js file. Use style and css loaders and then the styles are injected in the style tag in html
- However, this is not the most optimized way.
- Also note, if we have imported css in js, then we need loaders foe webpack to run.
